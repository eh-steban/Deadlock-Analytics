# Deployment Strategy

Production deployment architecture and future plans.

## Current State

**Status:** Planning phase

**Environment:**
- Local development: Docker Compose ✅
- CI: GitHub Actions ✅
- Staging: Not yet deployed
- Production: Not yet deployed

## Deployment Goals

1. **High availability:** 99.9% uptime SLA
2. **Scalability:** Handle 10k+ concurrent users
3. **Security:** Zero-trust network, encrypted traffic
4. **Observability:** Full visibility into system health
5. **Cost-effective:** Optimize resource usage

## Kubernetes Architecture (Planned)

### Why Kubernetes?

- Industry standard for container orchestration
- Built-in service discovery, load balancing
- Self-healing (automatic restarts, health checks)
- Horizontal scaling (add/remove pods dynamically)
- Cloud-agnostic (works on AWS, GCP, Azure, bare metal)

### Namespace Strategy

```yaml
# Staging environment
namespace: dashjump-staging

# Production environment
namespace: dashjump-production
```

**Benefits:**
- Isolation between environments
- Separate resource quotas
- Role-based access control per environment
